# Go Learning

## Module 1: Go Foundations (Week 1)

**Goal:** Get Go installed, understand syntax, variables, and control flow.

### Core Concepts

- Installing Go & “Hello World”
- Variables, Constants, and Data Types
- Operators & Expressions
- Conditional Statements (if, switch)
- Loops (for)

### Bite-Sized Projects

- ✅ Project 1: Hello Go!

  Print “Hello, Go World!” and system information using runtime package.

- ✅ Project 2: Temperature Converter

  Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit using variables and user input.

- ✅ Project 3: Even/Odd Classifier

  Take user input and classify numbers as even/odd using conditionals.

- ✅ Project 4: FizzBuzz Go Style

  Implement FizzBuzz using for loops and conditionals.

### Mid-Sized Project

- ✅ CLI Calculator

  Build a simple command-line calculator that performs +, -, ×, ÷ using user input, variables, and control flow.

## Module 2: Functions, Arrays, Slices & Maps (Week 2)

**Goal:** Learn how Go handles data collections and modularity.

### Core Concepts

- Defining and Calling Functions
- Arrays & Slices
- Maps (key-value pairs)
- range loops

### Bite-Sized Projects

- Project 1: Sum of Numbers

  Write a function that sums a slice of integers.

- Project 2: Word Frequency Counter

  Given a string, use a map to count how many times each word appears.

- Project 3: Find Maximum in Array

  Create a function that returns the largest number from a slice.

### Mid-Sized Project

- Student Grades Manager

  Store and manipulate student names, marks, and calculate averages using slices, maps, and functions.

## Module 3: Structs, Methods, and Pointers (Week 3)

**Goal:** Understand Go’s type system, object-like structures, and memory model.

### Core Concepts

- Structs
- Methods (attached to structs)
- Pointers and Memory References

### Bite-Sized Projects

- Project 1: Book Struct

  Define a Book struct and print book details.

- Project 2: Rectangle Area Calculator

  Add a method to Rectangle struct to calculate area.
